# react-wave
A react app for visualization of wave forms

This app uses React to visualize a Sine function under the effect of the following modifiable parameters:
-Frequency (in Hz)
-Number of cycles to present
-Phase (in degrees)

Besides, it enables the user to enhance the render by means of an scalable plot (in Y axis) and a modifiable resolution per cylcle (sampling rate).
