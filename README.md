# react-wave
A react app for visualization of wave forms

This app uses React to visualize a Sine function under the effect of the following modifiable parameters:

-Frequency (in Hz)

-Number of cycles to present

-Phase (in degrees)

Besides, it enables the user to enhance the render by means of an scalable plot (in Y axis) and a modifiable resolution per cycle (sampling rate).
